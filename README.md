# Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step2---AccuracyCaluclation
In this Repo I will use different Algorithms to Calculate and improve accuracy.

In My previous Repo- Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step2--AccuracyCaluclation, I discussed Steps for Cleaning and Tidying the Data Set, these are First and Foremost Steps one should Follow while They are working on any Dataset. our next motive is Caluclating the Accuracy of our Dataset By applying some ML Algorithms, So in this Repo i will be dealing with those Algorithms.

## The Algorithms i used are:
     1. Naive Bayes Algorithm.
     2. K- Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
     3. Support Vector Machine.
     
### Follow the Below Steps To Get complete outlook on Accuracy Caluclation:
     Step1: Take a Dataset and Apply these Algorithms(I provided the codes separately), and caluclate accuracy for each of them.
     Step2: Now we shall do a crazy thing by delibrately adding missing values into the dataset and Now run the above algorithms to see the accuracy change, obviously the accuracy decreases.
     Step3: Now take the missing values dataset and fill the missing values using Mean, Median, Mode, K-nearest Neighbors, Multivariate imputations and Deep Learning methods (Which i discussed in my previous Repo(Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step1--DataPreprocessing.
     Step4: For the above generated dataset once again apply accuracy algorithms and check which filling method produces more accuracy.
