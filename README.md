# Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step2---AccuracyCaluclation
In this Repo I will use different Algorithms to Calculate and improve accuracy.
## The Algorithms i used are:
     1. Naive Bayes Algorithm.
     2. K- Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
     3. Support Vector Machine.
     
### Follow the Below Steps To Get complete outlook on Accuracy Caluclation:
     Step1: Take a Dataset and Apply these Algorithms(I provided the codes separately), and caluclate accuracy for each of them.
     Step2: Now we shall do a crazy thing by delibrately adding missing values into the dataset and Now run the above algorithms to see the accuracy change, obviously the accuracy decreases.
     Step3: Now take the missing values dataset and fill the missing values using Mean, Median, Mode, K-nearest Neighbors, Multivariate imputations and Deep Learning methods (Which i discussed in my previous Repo(Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step1--DataPreprocessing.
     Step4: For the above generated dataset once again apply accuracy algorithms and check which filling method produces more accuracy.
